# Epinewbie

Epinewbie is a discord bot that allow you to access openAI chatGPT3 as well as fetching news from the [Epita news website](https://news.infinity.study/).


**Note: for the bot to work it is necessary to create a .env file with your API key for ChatGPT (you can find it [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)) as well as a valid discord bot token (can be found on the [discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers))**

*Another Note: the code is far from perfect and would need some really good refactoring*
